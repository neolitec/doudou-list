# Create a React project

Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It's particularly well-suited for frameworks like React. In this lesson, we'll walk through the steps to set up a new React + Typescript project using Vite.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't have it, [download it here](https://nodejs.org/).
- Since we are using `pnpm` as a package manager, you need to install it globally on your machine. To do so, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

- Basic knowledge of the terminal ðŸ˜…

## Create a new project

__<span style="color: green">This part is already done!</span>__ But we let the instructions here for reference.

This comand will create a new folder called `doudou-list` and initialize a new project inside it.

```bash
pnpm create vite doudou-list --template react-swc-ts
```

## Install the dependencies

Since the dependencies are not installed by default, we need to install them manually. To do so, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Start the development server

To start the development server, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Now we are ready to start coding! ðŸŽ‰
