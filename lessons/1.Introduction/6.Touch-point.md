# Introduction - Touch Point

As we pause for a brief moment on this learning journey, let's reflect on the important concepts we've explored thus far. This touch point will serve as a recap and help solidify the knowledge acquired.

1. Project Structure:
We began by understanding the structure of our React project, familiarizing ourselves with the various files and folders generated by Vite.
2. First Component:
We dove into the world of React by creating our first component, `Task`, which introduced us to the JSX syntax and the concept of props.
3. Events:
We then explored callbacks in React, creating a `Button` component to handle user interactions, thus gaining insight into how functions can be passed as props to handle events.
4. First Hook:
Following that, we created our first custom hook, `useTasks`, which provided us with a structured way to manage the state of our application and handle user interactions in a more organized manner.
5. Utilizing Callbacks and Hooks Together:
We integrated the knowledge of callbacks and hooks by using a Button component to add and remove tasks, demonstrating how these concepts work together to manage state and handle user interactions.
6. JavaScript Essentials:
Alongside React-specific concepts, we also brushed up on essential JavaScript features like destructuring, which simplifies the extraction of values from objects and arrays.

This touch point marks a significant milestone in our learning journey. We've laid a strong foundation, understanding the basic building blocks of a React application. As we move forward, we'll build upon this foundation, exploring more advanced concepts, diving deeper into state management and much more.

Ensure you're comfortable with the material covered so far, as it forms the bedrock for the upcoming chapters. Feel free to revisit any of the previous chapters to reinforce your understanding, and practice by extending the functionality of the to-do application we've begun building.
