# 1.2. Project structure

In this chapter, we are going to explore the structure of the project generated by Vite, which is a modern build tool for React applications. Here is a description of the key files and folders:


    â”œâ”€â”€ package.json               # File containing project metadata and dependencies
    â”œâ”€â”€ pnpm-lock.yaml             # A snapshot of the exact versions of installed modules
    â”œâ”€â”€ public
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ vite.svg               # Vite logo, can be deleted or replaced
    â”œâ”€â”€ src                        # Folder containing the source code of the application
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.css                # CSS file for the App component
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx                # Root component of the React application
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets                 # Folder for static assets like images
    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ react.svg          # React logo, can be deleted or replaced
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.css              # Global CSS file
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.tsx               # Main entry point of the application
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ vite-env.d.ts          # Type declarations for Vite environment variables
    â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json              # TypeScript configuration for the project
    â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.node.json         # Node.js specific TypeScript configuration (if necessary)
    â””â”€â”€ vite.config.ts             # Vite configuration for the project


- `package.json`: This file contains your project's metadata, including dependencies (libraries and frameworks your project uses) and scripts you can run to build, test, and start your application.
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`: This file is automatically created and updated by pnpm (an alternative package manager to npm). It contains precise information about the exact versions of dependencies installed in your project.
- `public`: This folder contains files that will be served as-is to the client, without being processed by the build system. It's common to place images, favicon files, and other static assets here.
- `src`: This is where the heart of your application resides. All your React components, hooks, assets, and CSS will be placed in this folder.
- `App.css`: This file contains CSS styles for the App.tsx component.
- `App.tsx`: This is the root component of your React application.
- `assets`: A folder for storing static assets like images, fonts, etc.
- `index.css`: This file contains global CSS styles for your application.
- `main.tsx`: This is the main entry point of your application, where React is rendered to the DOM.
- `vite-env.d.ts`: This file contains type declarations for Vite environment variables.
- `tsconfig.json`: This file contains the TypeScript configuration for your project. It sets options like file paths, ECMAScript compatibility levels, and other TypeScript-related configurations.
- `tsconfig.node.json`: This file is a Node.js specific TypeScript configuration, if necessary for your project.
- `vite.config.ts`: This file contains the Vite configuration for your project. You can configure plugins, set environment variables, and adjust the behavior of the build system and development server here.

## Let's cleanup things a bit

There's some files that we don't need for this project. You can safely delete some files and folders but I let you find out which ones. ðŸ˜‰

__Tip__: Run the app with `npm dev` to see it the app still works after deleting some files.
