In React, a callback is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. This concept is vital in React, especially when dealing with user interactions and state changes.

## Creating a Button Component

We'll create a simple Button component to demonstrate the use of callbacks.

Inside the `src/components` directory, create a new file named `Button.tsx`:

```tsx
import React from 'react'

interface ButtonProps {
  onClick: () => void
  label: string
}

export default function Button({ onClick, label }: ButtonProps) {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>
}

export default Button
```

In this component:

- We define a TypeScript interface ButtonProps to specify the types of props our component will receive.
- We create a functional component Button that takes onClick and label as props.
- Inside the component, we return a button element with an onClick handler and a label.

## Using the `Button` Component in the `App` Component

Now letâ€™s use the `Button` component in our `App` component to demonstrate the use of callbacks.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import Button from './components/Button'

export default function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  const handleIncrement = () => {
    setCount(count + 1)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={handleIncrement} label="Increment" />
      <div>Count: {count}</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

In the App component:

- We import the `useState` hook from React to manage the state of count.
- We define a function `handleIncrement` that increments the count.
- We render the `Button` component, passing the `handleIncrement` function as a callback to the `onClick` prop, and "Increment" as the label.

Now, whenever you click the "Increment" button, the `handleIncrement` function will be called, updating the `count` state and demonstrating the use of callbacks in React.

This chapter provides a clear understanding of how callbacks work in React and sets the stage for more complex state management and user interaction patterns in the upcoming chapters.
