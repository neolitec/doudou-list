# 1.5. First hook

Having explored callbacks in the previous chapter, let's delve into React hooks, which provide a way to use state and other React features without writing a class. We'll create a simple custom hook called `useTasks` to manage a list of tasks.

## Creating a Custom Hook

Inside the src directory, create a new folder named `hooks`.

Create a `hooks/useTasks.ts` file and write the following code:

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react'

interface Task {
  id: number
  text: string
}

export default function useTasks() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState<Task[]>([])

  const addTask = (text: string) => {
    setTasks((prevTasks) => [...prevTasks, { id: Date.now(), text }])
  }

  const removeTask = (id: number) => {
    setTasks((prevTasks) => prevTasks.filter(task => task.id !== id))
  }

  return { tasks, addTask, removeTask }
}
```

In this hook:

- We import `useState` from `react`.
- We define an interface `Task` to describe the shape of a task object.
- We declare a state variable `tasks` using `useState`, which will hold an array of `Task` objects.
- We define `addTask` and `removeTask` functions to add and remove tasks, respectively.
- We return an object containing `tasks`, `addTask`, and `removeTask` so they can be used by components.

## Using the `useTasks` Hook in the `App` Component

Now letâ€™s use the `useTasks` hook in our `App` component:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import Button from './components/Button';
import useTasks from './hooks/useTasks';

export default function App() {
  const { tasks, addTask, removeTask } = useTasks()

  return (
    <div>
      {/* ... You can keep what we made before here if you want. */}
      {/* BTW, this is how we write a comment in a middle of JSX. */}
      {/*
        Or like this.
      */}
      <Button onClick={() => addTask('New Task')} label="Add Task" />
      {tasks.map(task => (
        <div key={task.id}>
          <div>{task.text}</div>
          <Button onClick={() => removeTask(task.id)} label="Remove" />
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

In the `App` component:

- We import the `useTasks` hook.
- We _destructure[^1]_ `tasks`, `addTask`, and `removeTask` from the `useTasks` hook.
- We render a `Button` component to add a new task, and map over the `tasks` array to render each task with a corresponding remove button.

This way, you've created and utilized a custom hook to manage the state of your application, furthering your understanding of how hooks and callbacks work together in React to manage state and handle user interactions.

This chapter builds on the concepts from the previous chapter, helping to form a more complete understanding of state management in React.

[^1]: In Javascript, destructuring assignment is a syntax feature that allows you to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables. This can make your code more readable and less verbose. See more on [mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment).
